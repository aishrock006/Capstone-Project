    "### Moving Average (MA)\n",
    "A moving average (rolling average or running average) is a calculation to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set. It is also called a moving mean (MM) or rolling mean and is a type of finite impulse response filter.\n",

    "Although, Trends from the data can be removed by ARIMA model. But the series can still have seasonal component. Since, our data may have slight seasonal component So we will use SARIMA instead of ARIMA.\n",
