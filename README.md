# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree 2020
###  Capstone Project 
## Time Series Analysis of Air Quality Data
<br>
<b>Install</b>
<br>
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

<br>* fbprophet
<br>* matplotlib
<br>* statsmodels
<br>* NumPy
<br>* Pandas
<br>* scikit-learn
<br><br>
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook
<br>
We recommend to install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.
<br><br><b>Code</b>
<br>Complete notebook is divided into various parts:
<br>* Part 1: 1Data Preprocessing
<br>* Part 2: 2Data Modelling with ARIMA
<br>* Part 3: 3Data Modelling with FBPhrophet
<br>* Part 4: 4Data Modelling with Holt Winter
<br>* Part 5: 5Training with LSTM 
<br>* Part 6: 6Final Model Evaluation and Prediction.
<br>
