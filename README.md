# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree 2020
###  Capstone Project 
## Time Series Analysis of Air Quality Data
<br>
<b>Install</b>
<br>
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:
<br>* matplotlib
<br>* statsmodels
<br>* NumPy
<br>* Pandas
<br>* scikit-learn
<br><br>
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook
<br>
We recommend to install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.
<br><br><b>Code</b>
<br>Complete notebook is divided into various parts:
<br>* Part 1: Data Preprocessing
<br>* Part 2: Data Modelling with ARIMA
<br>* Part 3: Data Modelling with FbPhrophet (will be done)
<br>* Part 4: Data Modelling with Holt Winter (will be done)
<br>* Part 5: Training with LSTM (will be done)
<br>* Part 6: Final Model Evaluation and Prediction. (will be done)
<br>

<b> Data </b>
<br>The Dataset consists of Air Quality data from 12 sites in beijing. The main pollutants are PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3
<br>Orignal raw data(of 12 multi-sites) is available in /beijing-multisite-airquality-data-set/ directory<br>
